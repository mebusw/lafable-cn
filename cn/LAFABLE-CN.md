# General
* THE TEAM  
团队
* Developers & Testers  
开发和测试人员  
	> Developers & Testers  
	> 开发和测试人员  
	> 
	> It is good to have at least a few developers and testers around so that the Product Owner and Stroll Master have people to boss around.  
	> 
	> 怎么也得有几名开发和测试人员围绕在产品拥有者和巡游大师的身边，让他们有当老板的感觉。
	
* Stroll Master  
巡游大师
	> Stroll Master  
	> 巡游大师 
	> 
	> A team’s Stroll Master acts as a coach for the team—yelling and berating the team at every opportunity. Always acting with an eye toward continuous improvement, a good Stroll Master can find innumerable ways for team members to improve and is not shy about sharing these with them. The best teams are staffed by a Certified StrollMaster who participated in a grueling two-day course to earn that certification.  
	> 
	> 巡游大师充当团队的教练，从不放过任何一个大喊大叫和斥责团队的机会。优秀的巡游主管总是着眼于团队的持续改进，为团队成员找到无数改进的方法，并且毫不吝惜地分享给团队。一个顶尖的团队通过都配有顶尖的巡游大师，参加为期两天的魔鬼训练营课程即可获得巡游大师认证证书。
	
* Architect  
架构师  
	> Architect  
	> 架构师  
	> 
	> Residing in an ivory tower, positioned well away from the need to dirty his or her hands with code, a LAFABLE project architect is responsible for giving the team lots of unsolicited advice. If anything goes wrong on a project, the Architect is required by LAFABLE to side with the product owner and Stroll Master in insisting that if the team had just built what was specified, the project would have been a success.  
	> 
	> 在LAFABLE中，架构师身处象牙塔上，无须担心编写代码这种卑微小事会弄脏他们高贵的手，不管团队是否需要，他们只负责提出大量不切实际的建议。如果一个项目出现了任何问题，LAFABLE要求架构师与产品拥有者和巡游主管站在一起，并坚信只要团队构建了要求的内容，项目一定会取得成功。
	
* Product Owner  
产品拥有者  
	> Product Owner  
	> 产品拥有者  
	> 
	> In LAFABLE, the product owner is responsible for making all decisions about the functionality of the product. To do that effectively, it is important for the product owner to own all the resources involved in the project—human and other.  
	> 
	> 在LAFABLE中, 产品拥有者决定产品功能。为了有效地实现这一点，产品拥有者必须拥有项目中涉及的一切资源——不但包括人力资源，还有其他一切！

# Phases
* PLANNING  
规划阶段
* STROLLING  
巡游阶段
* STABILIZATION  
稳固阶段

# Release choo choo
* release choo choo  
发布火车呜呜  

	> On a LAFABLE project, the Release Choo Choo is set in motion during the Planning Phase  
	> 
	> 在LAFABLE项目中，发布火车呜呜是在计划阶段启动的  
	> 
	> During a project’s strolls, the Release Choo Choo is picking up steam and rumbling down the tracks  
	> 
	> 在项目巡游阶段，发布火车呜呜忙得不可开交，一路高歌猛进  
	> 
	> During the Stabilization phase, the Release Choo Choo is shown to be a train wreck. Train wreck! The Release Choo Choo goes off track, sliding off the top of the product backlog and crashing into reality  
	> 
	> 在稳固阶段，发布火车呜呜其实是一列失事的火车。火车失事啦！所有人在现实中惊醒，发布火车呜呜早已偏离了产品待办列表的轨道

# Planning phase
* Backlog of Backlogs  
待办列表的待办列表  
	> Backlog of Backlogs  
	> 待办列表的待办列表  
	> 
	> There are so many backlogs in LAFABLE that the team maintains a backlog of backlogs just to keep things straight.  
	> 
	> 在LAFABLE里有太多的待办列表了，团队维护待办列表的待办列表只是为了让工作清晰一点。
	
* Product Backlog  
产品待办列表
	> roduct Backlog  
	> 产品待办列表  
	> 
	> The product backlog contains everything the product owner demands be in the product. If a feature is not in the product backlog, LAFABLE rules prevent the product owner from yelling at the team about not getting that feature. Fortunately, another LAFABLE rule allows the product owner to add to the product backlog at any time, including right before yelling at the team.  
	> 
	> 产品待办列表中包含了产品拥有者对该产品的所有需求。如果某个功能不在产品待办列表中，根据LAFABLE的规则，产品拥有者不能因为没有获得该功能而对团队大呼小叫。幸运的是，根据LAFABLE的另一条规则，产品拥有者可以随时向产品待办列表中添加内容，哪怕是在对团队大呼小叫之前。
	
* Team selects Date and scope to be delivered  
团队选择交付日期和范围  
	> Team’s Delivery Date Estimate  
	> 团队交付日期估算  
	> 
	> The team produces a date estimate range of when the product will be finished. This estimate is produced solely for the amusement of stakeholders and external management. No one pays any attention to it.  
	> 
	> 团队会拍脑袋估计一个大致的产品交付日期，编造这个数字完全是为了取悦利益相关者和外部管理人员，没有人会真正关心。
	
* Business pays lip service to team's estimates  
业务方口头上支持团队的估算  
	> Lip Service  
	> 口头支持  
	> 
	> While paying lip service to having the team estimate their own work, the business stakeholders lock down a due date based on desired functionality, whim, and a disconnect from reality. Out of respect for developers’ and testers’ time, they are not consulted to create this estimate.  
	> 
	> 虽然口头上答应让团队评估他们自己的工作，但是业务方会根据自己对功能的期待，心血来潮并不切实际地地确定一个交付日期。考虑到开发和测试人员时间的宝贵，最终确定的交付日期也不必征询他们的意见。
	
* ...But picks earlier date. Makes up for it, though, by expecting more functionality by that date  
...但是，他们会挑选一个更早的日期，并且在这个时限内增加更多的功能  
	> Deadline  
	> 最后期限  
	> 
	> A deadline for the project is published. Deadlines in LAFABLE are most commonly selected by taking the team’s expected finish date, halving it, and decreasing the unit of measure. In that way, a team that expects to finish in 4 months will be given a deadline of two weeks.   
	> 
	> 项目的最后期限公布了。在LAFABLE中，通常是先将团队的预期完成日期砍掉一半，再缩小度量单位来得到最后期限。这样，一个预期在4个月内完成任务的团队将获得2周的交货期限。

# Strolling phase
* Team Backlog  
团队待办列表  
	> Team Backlog  
	> 团队待办列表
	> 
	> The Team Backlog contains all the items that must be finished during the Stroll. A Team Backlog is created by the project’s Tech Lead who assigns tasks out to other team members while personally retaining the best, most enjoyable tasks.   
	> 
	> 团队待办列表中包含了巡游过程中所有必须完成的内容。团队待办列表是由项目的技术主管创建的，他将任务分配给其他团队成员，同时，自己保留最好、最有意思的任务。
		
* Personal Backlog  
个人待办列表  
	> Personal Backlog  
	> 个人待办列表  
	> 
	> To avoid difficult to manage shared responsibility, each team member has a Personal Backlog of tasks that he or she is personally responsible for. If a team member does not finish all items on his or her Personal Backlog, the team member should not expect help from other team members who are expected to instead jump ahead to work for the next Stroll.  
	> 
	> 为了避免对共同责任的管理困难，每个团队成员都拥有个人待办列表，里面都是他/她自己负责的任务。如果某个团队成员没有完成自己的个人待办列表中的所有内容，那么他/她不要奢望可以从其他人那里获得帮助，因为其他团队成员会被要求提前开始下一次巡游。
	
* Pair Managing  
结对管理  
	> Pair Managing  
	> 结对管理  
	> 
	> Building on the success of pair programming, LAFABLE incorporates pair managing, in which each developer or tester is watched by two managers. With two pairs of eyes on each task, it becomes extremely unlikely that an opportunity for micromanagement will go unnoticed.   
	> 
	> 基于结对编程的成功，LAFABLE引入了结对管理，每个开发或测试人员都由两名经理监控着。每项任务都有两双眼睛盯着，每一个微观管理的机会都绝对不会被忽视。
	
* Definition of Mostly Begun  
『差不多可以开始』的定义  
	> Definition of Mostly Begun  
	> 『差不多可以开始』的定义
	> 
	> Each team establishes a Definition of Mostly Begun. A task cannot be said to have begun until it complies with this definition. A typical definition of mostly begun includes:  
	> <ul>
	> <li>Developer has had morning caffeinated drink</li>
	> <li>Developer has read favorite internet morning news site</li>
	> <li>Developer has heard of the task</li>
	> </ul>
	> Once these things are complete, the developer is able to report in a daily standup that work on the task has begun.  
	> 
	> 每一个团队都建立了『差不多可以开始』的定义。任何任务在满足这个定义之前，都不能被称为已开始。典型的定义内容包括：  
	> <ul>
	> <li>开发人员早上已经喝过咖啡了</li>
	> <li>开发人员已经阅读过最爱看的早间新闻</li>
	> <li>开发人员听说过这个任务</li>
	> </ul>  
	> 一旦这些事情都完成了，开发人员就可以在每日站会上报告这项任务已经开始了。

* Definition of Done on my machine  
『在我的设备上已完成』的定义  
	> Definition of Done on my machine  
	> 『在我的设备上已完成』的定义  
	> 
	> Once a developer has seen a feature work even once on his or her own machine that feature may be reported as “Done on My Machine.” In LAFABLE, senior developers are held to a higher standard and cannot report something as Done on My Machine unless it has worked multiple times on their machines.  
	> 
	> 一旦开发人员看到某个功能在他/她自己的设备上运行了一次，这个特性就可以被汇报『在我的设备上已完成』。在LAFABLE中，资深开发人员需要遵守更高的标准，只有某个特性在他们的设备上运行过多次，才能被称为『在我的设备上已完成』。
	
* Definition of Mostly Done  
『差不多完成』的定义  
	> Definition of Mostly Done  
	> 『差不多完成』的定义  
	> 
	> In order to avoid communication problems, LAFABLE teams establish a Definition of Mostly Done. Once an item is Mostly Done, it is often deployed into production use. Doing so engages users in the testing process. Making users feel a part of the process is more important than giving them high quality features and so the product is delivered to them well before it should be.  
	> 
	> 为了避免沟通问题，在LAFABLE中，团队会建立一个『差不多完成』的定义。一旦一项需求差不多完成了，就会被部署到生产环境中。这样会让用户参与到测试过程。这让用户觉得参与到产品开发过程中比拿到高质量的功能更重要，这样产品可以早早地交付给他们。
	
* Definition of We Really Mean It's Done this time  
『这次我们真的认为完成了』的定义  
	> Definition of We Really Mean It's Done this time  
	> 『这次我们真的认为完成了』的定义  
	> 
	> Finally, functionality reaches a state where the team really means it’s done this time. Really. They do. Except the testers have not touched it yet. That happens in Stabilization.  
	> 
	> 终于，功能达到了团队真的认为完成了的状态，真的，他们做到了。只是测试人员还没有看到这个功能，测试是稳定阶段才会发生的事。

# Stabilization phase
* Testers Get First Look at the System  
测试人员初次接触系统  
	> Testers Get First Look at the System  
	> 测试人员初次接触系统
	> 
	> After all Strolls are complete, it is time to involve the testers. In LAFABLE, all testing is done during a lengthy Stabilization phase. Don’t worry, though, it’s not that lengthy. LAFABLE rules dictate that teams spend no more than half the time required to find and fix all defects, ensuring you beat your competitors to market with a low-quality release.  
	> 
	> 所有的巡游都结束了，是时候让测试人员参与进来了！在LAFABLE中，所有的测试工作都是在漫长的稳定阶段进行的。不过别担心，也不是很漫长。根据LAFABLE的规则，团队花费的测试时间不能超过发现和修复所有缺陷所花时间的一半，从而确保您可以使用一个低质量的发布版本在市场上击败竞争对手。
	
* Product Owner's Hidden Agenda Backlog  
产品拥有者的隐藏待办列表  
	> Product Owner's Hidden Agenda Backlog  
	> 产品拥有者的隐藏待办列表
	> 
	> LAFABLE teams are told to “embrace change.” A product owner ensures a team’s ability to do this by deliberately holding some requirements back to be introduced later in the project. By introducing important functionality and architectural changes late in a project, a product owner can keep a team prepared for change at any time.  
	> 
	> 在LAFABLE中，团队被要求“拥抱变化”。产品拥有者通过故意将一些需求拖到项目后期才引入，来确保团队具备“拥抱变化”的能力。通过在项目后期引入重要的功能和实施架构上的变更，产品拥有者确保团队可以随时应对变更。
	
* Fight Over Meaning of Requirments Documents  
为文档中需求的真正含义而斗争  
	> Boxing Gloves  
	> 拳击手套  
	> 
	> Because the written word is subject to interpretation and because all communication on LAFABLE projects is written, the product owner, Stroll Master and team members engage in a three-way battle. At stake is ownership of the intent of various statements in a document. Whichever group wins this battle and owns the intent will be able to say to others, “Well, I see how you could interpret this requirement that way, but let me assure you that isn’t what it means.”  
	> 
	> 在LAFABLE中，所有的沟通都是书面的，所有书面文档都需要进行解释，因此，产品拥有者、巡游主管和其他团队成员陷入了三方战斗。这场斗争关系到书面文档中各种形式陈述的最终解释权，因此，无论谁赢得了这场战斗并拥有了最终解释权，都可以对其他人说：“好吧，我知道你是怎样解读这种需求的，但我向你保证，那不是他真正的含义！”
	
* Rapid Descoping Phase  
快速砍需求阶段  
	> Rapid Descoping Phase  
	> 快速砍需求阶段  
	> 
	> The important, final phase on a LAFABLE project is the rapid descoping of all features that could not be delivered in the ample time provided to the team.  
	> 
	> 对于LAFABLE项目来说，最重要也是最后的阶段是，将那些不能给团队提供足够时间进行交付的功能快速移除出项目范围。
